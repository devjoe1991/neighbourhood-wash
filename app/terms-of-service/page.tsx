                2.1. A Booking Platform
              </h3>
              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                Neighbourhood Wash provides a technology platform that connects
                Users seeking laundry services with local, independent Washers.
                We act as a booking agency and facilitator only. Our service is
                the provision of this Platform, not the provision of laundry
                services themselves.
              </p>

              <h3 className='mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900'>
                2.2. Independent Contractors
              </h3>
              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                You acknowledge and agree that Washers are independent,
                self-employed contractors, not employees, agents, or partners of
                Neighbourhood Wash. The contract for the provision of the actual
                laundry Services is a direct contract between the User and the
                Washer. Neighbourhood Wash is not a party to that contract.
              </p>

              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                While we vet prospective Washers, which includes an application
                review and mandatory ID verification through our partner Stripe,
                we do not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of the
                Services they provide. We do not and cannot guarantee the
                accuracy or completeness of these checks. You engage with
                Washers at your own risk.

              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                To use most features of the Platform, you must register for an

              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                Prospective Washers must complete a detailed application, pay a
                one-time, non-refundable Onboarding Fee of <strong>Â£50</strong>,
                unless specific promotions are offered which can change this fee
                at any time. They must successfully complete our vetting
                process, including identity verification via Stripe Identity. To
                receive payments, all Washers must create a Stripe Connect
                Express account and agree to Stripe's terms and conditions.

                4.1. Creating a Booking
              </h3>
              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                A User requests a Booking by selecting the required Services
                (e.g., wash, dry, iron, stain removal, hypoallergenic wash) and
                an available time slot. Users may add special instructions
                (e.g., for allergies, detergent preferences, or specific care).
                The Platform will then either make the booking available to
                Washers to accept or automatically assign it to the closest and
                most available Washer within 24 hours of the requested booking
                time.
              </p>

              <h3 className='mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900'>
                4.2. 8:00 PM Booking Restriction
              </h3>
              <div className='mb-4 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 p-4'>
                <p className='text-yellow-800'>
                  To prevent noise disturbances and anti-social behaviour in
                  residential areas, the Platform strictly prohibits booking
                  time slots that end after 8:00 PM. Users will not be able to
                  select or request such time slots during the booking process.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3 className='mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900'>
                4.3. PIN Verification System
              </h3>
              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                Upon booking confirmation, a unique{' '}
                <strong>Drop-off PIN</strong> is generated. The Washer must
                enter this PIN into their dashboard to confirm they have
                received the User's laundry.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                Upon service completion, a second unique{' '}
                <strong>Pick-up PIN</strong> is generated. The User provides
                this Pick-up PIN to the Washer, who must enter it to confirm the
                service is complete and the items have been returned to the
                User.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                This dual PIN system creates a timestamped, digital chain of
                custody. Verification of the Pick-up PIN serves as the User's
                confirmation that the Service is complete and the items have
                been returned to their satisfaction. This action triggers the
                final payment capture.
              </p>

              <div className='mb-4 border-l-4 border-red-400 bg-red-50 p-4'>
                <p className='mb-2 font-medium text-red-900'>
                  By confirming a Booking, you, the User, explicitly agree and

                    garments for personal items (e.g., keys, wallets, phones)
                    before handover. Neighbourhood Wash and the Washer are not
                    liable for any damage to your personal items or the Washer's
                    equipment caused by items left in clothing.

              <p className='mb-4 text-gray-700'>
                Users and Washers have the option to arrange to meet at
                pre-determined safe pick-up and drop-off points to avoid
                disclosing personal addresses. If this option is chosen,
                personal addresses associated with the booking will not be
                displayed. If direct home pick-up/drop-off is selected,
                addresses will only be visible to the relevant parties (User and
                Washer) during the hour before and the hour after the scheduled
                booking time and its completion.
