## 1. User Cancellations

Users may cancel a booking according to the following timeframes:

* **More than 12 hours before the booking slot**: A User may cancel their booking and receive a **full refund** to their original payment method.
* **Less than 12 hours before the booking slot**: Cancellations made within this window are **not eligible for a refund**. This is to compensate the Washer for the reserved time slot they can no longer fill and for any preparation they may have undertaken.

## 2. Washer Cancellations

Washers may cancel a booking, but different conditions and penalties apply depending on the timing:

* **Cancellation more than 12 hours before the booking slot**: If a Washer cancels a booking more than 12 hours before the scheduled drop-off time, the User will receive a **full and automatic refund**. No penalty will be applied to the Washer's account.
* **Cancellation within 12 hours of the booking slot**: If a Washer cancels a booking within 12 hours of the scheduled drop-off time, the User will receive a **full and automatic refund**. In addition, the Washer will be liable to pay a penalty equivalent to the full price of the cancelled booking, plus an additional penalty fee of **Â£10**. This amount will be deducted from the Washer's earnings wallet or charged to their linked payment method.
* **Repeated Cancellations**: A "marker" will be applied to a Washer's profile for each cancellation within the 12-hour window. If a Washer accumulates **three (3) such markers** within a 6-month period, their account status will be reviewed, and they may face temporary suspension or permanent termination from the Platform at our sole discretion.

## 3. Refund Processing

* All refunds are processed securely through **Stripe** back to the original payment method.
* Once initiated, refunds may take **5-10 business days** to appear on your bank or credit card statement, depending on your bank's processing times.
* Neighbourhood Wash is not responsible for any delays caused by banks or payment processors.

## 4. Exceptional Circumstances

Neighbourhood Wash reserves the right to make exceptions to this Cancellation & Refund Policy in cases of genuine emergency or extenuating circumstances (e.g., severe illness, unforeseen events), at our sole discretion. Any such exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and do not set a precedent. Evidence may be required.
