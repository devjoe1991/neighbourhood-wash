# Washer Agreement

Last Updated: 13 July 2025

This agreement forms a distinct part of the main Terms of Service and must be explicitly agreed to during the Washer onboarding process.

By becoming a Washer on the Neighbourhood Wash platform, you agree to the following additional terms:

---

## 1. Independent Contractor Status

You acknowledge and agree that you are operating as a self-employed independent contractor. You are not an employee, partner, or agent of Neighbourhood Wash. You are solely responsible for:

- Paying your own income tax and National Insurance contributions.
- Managing your own business expenses, including but not limited to, laundry supplies, equipment maintenance, and transportation.
- Your own work schedule and deciding which bookings to accept.
- Any licenses, permits, or registrations required for your self-employed activity.

## 2. Service Level Expectations

You commit to providing a high-quality, professional service to all Users, which includes:

- **Quality**: Performing all Services (washing, drying, ironing, stain removal, hypoallergenic washing) to a high standard, following any reasonable and clearly communicated instructions from the User.
- **Hygiene**: Using clean, well-maintained domestic equipment (washing machine, dryer, iron) and appropriate, non-damaging, and where specified, hypoallergenic cleaning products. Your home environment where laundry is processed must be clean and hygienic.
- **Timeliness & Communication**: Being on time for scheduled handovers and communicating professionally and promptly with Users via the in-app chat feature regarding any delays, issues, or questions.
- **Care for Garments**: Exercising reasonable care in handling all items. You acknowledge that Neighbourhood Wash is not liable for items left in User's pockets that may cause damage to your equipment or the garment itself. Users are responsible for checking their garments.
- **Special Services**: If offering stain removal or ironing, you must possess the necessary skills and equipment to perform these services effectively and safely.
- **Allergies & Sensitivities**: You understand and agree to adhere to the **Pet-Free & Smoke-Free Policy** detailed below, and to use hypoallergenic products when requested by a User to accommodate sensitive skin or allergies.

## 3. Insurance (Crucial)

You acknowledge that Neighbourhood Wash **DOES NOT** provide any form of public liability or business insurance to Washers. It is your **sole responsibility** to obtain and maintain adequate insurance to cover potential damages, accidents, or liabilities arising from your provision of Services on the Platform. This includes, but is not limited to, damage to User's property, damage to your own property, personal injury, or any claims arising from the laundry services you provide. We strongly recommend you seek professional advice on appropriate insurance coverage.

## 4. Financial Agreement

You explicitly agree to the following financial terms:

- The one-time, non-refundable Onboarding Fee of **£50**, which may be subject to change due to promotions.
- The **15% Service Commission** that Neighbourhood Wash deducts from the total booking price paid by the User. You acknowledge that this commission rate may change at any time, and we reserve the right to modify it with prior notice.
- The **£2.50 Payout Fee** for each withdrawal from your earnings wallet. You acknowledge that this payout fee may change at any time, and we reserve the right to modify it with prior notice.
- You acknowledge that all payments will be processed via Stripe Connect, and by creating an account, you agree to Stripe's connected account agreement, which governs their financial services.

## 5. Tax Responsibility

You are solely responsible for declaring and paying all applicable income tax and National Insurance contributions to HMRC (His Majesty's Revenue and Customs) on all earnings received through the Neighbourhood Wash Platform. Neighbourhood Wash will not deduct taxes or contributions on your behalf.

---

## 6. Washer Cancellations & Penalties

We understand that cancellations may occasionally be unavoidable. However, to maintain platform reliability and compensate Users and Washers for lost time and opportunity, the following applies:

- **Cancellation within 12 hours of the booking slot**: If you, the Washer, cancel a booking within 12 hours of the scheduled drop-off time, the User will receive a full and automatic refund. In addition, you will be liable to pay a penalty equivalent to the full price of the cancelled booking, plus an additional penalty fee of **£10**. This amount will be deducted from your earnings wallet or charged to your linked payment method.
- **Repeated Cancellations**: A record (or "marker") will be applied to your Washer profile for each cancellation within the 12-hour window. If you accumulate **three (3) such markers** within a 6-month period, your account status will be reviewed, and you may face temporary suspension or permanent termination from the Platform at our sole discretion.
- **Cancellations outside 12 hours**: If you cancel a booking more than 12 hours before the scheduled drop-off time, the User will receive a full refund, and no penalty will be applied to your account.

## 7. Pet-Free & Smoke-Free Policy

To ensure the safety and comfort of all Users, particularly those with allergies, all Washers on the Neighbourhood Wash platform must adhere to a strict **pet-free and smoke-free policy** within their laundry area and on any equipment used for Services. This means:

- No pets should be present in the area where laundry is washed, dried, or stored.
- No smoking should occur in the area where laundry is processed or stored.
- Equipment (washing machine, dryer, baskets) must be free from pet hair, dander, and smoke residue.

Violation of this policy will result in immediate account review and potential termination. This policy is enforced universally across all Washers to ensure a consistent and safe experience for all Users, and is not subject to individual preference.
