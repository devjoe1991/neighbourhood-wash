# Community Guidelines & Acceptable Use Policy

Last Updated: 13 July 2025

These Community Guidelines and Acceptable Use Policy are an integral part of our Terms of Service and apply to all Users and Washers on the Neighbourhood Wash Platform. They are designed to foster a safe, respectful, and reliable community. Your continued use of the Platform signifies your agreement to adhere to these guidelines.

---

## 1. Respectful Conduct

We expect all users to interact with each other with courtesy and respect.

- **No Abuse**: Any form of physical, verbal, or mental abuse, harassment, threats, discrimination, or hate speech directed towards any other user, our staff, or third parties will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive language, intimidation, or any behaviour that creates a hostile environment. Violation of this rule will lead to immediate account termination and, if necessary, details being shared with relevant authorities.
- **Professional Communication**: Maintain clear, polite, and constructive communication through the in-app chat feature.
- **Privacy**: Do not share personal information of others without their explicit consent.
- **Non-Discrimination**: Neighbourhood Wash is committed to providing a platform free from discrimination. Users and Washers must not discriminate against any individual based on race, colour, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic.

## 2. Platform Integrity & Fair Use

To ensure a fair and functional marketplace, you must:

- **Honesty & Accuracy**: Provide accurate and truthful information during registration, booking, and when providing Services. Do not misrepresent yourself, your capabilities, or your items.
- **No Circumvention**: All bookings and payments for laundry services facilitated through Neighbourhood Wash must be made exclusively through the Platform. Attempting to arrange services or payments outside the Platform ("off-platform transactions") is strictly prohibited and will result in account termination.
- **Accurate Reviews & Ratings**: Provide honest, fair, and constructive feedback in reviews and ratings. Do not manipulate ratings, post fake reviews, or retaliate with negative reviews.
- **No Misuse**: Do not use the Platform for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorised purpose. This includes, but is not limited to, money laundering, drug-related activities, or any activity that violates UK law.

## 3. Hygiene & Safety Standards

### For Users:

- **Pre-Check Garments**: It is your responsibility to thoroughly check all garments for personal items (e.g., keys, wallets, phones, jewellery, sharp objects) before handing them over to a Washer. Neighbourhood Wash and the Washer are not liable for any damage to your personal items or to the Washer's equipment caused by items left in clothing.
- **Reasonable Cleanliness**: Laundry must be in a reasonable state of cleanliness and free from hazardous materials, excessive bodily fluids, or excessive animal hair. Washers reserve the right to refuse service for items deemed unhygienic or hazardous, with appropriate notice to the User.

### For Washers:

- **Clean & Safe Equipment**: You must use clean, well-maintained, and safe domestic washing machines, dryers, and ironing equipment.
- **Appropriate Products**: Use appropriate, non-damaging, and effective cleaning products. If a User requests hypoallergenic products for sensitive skin or allergies, you must use suitable alternatives as instructed by the User or decline the booking if unable to meet the request.
- **Pet-Free & Smoke-Free Environment**: As detailed in the Washer Agreement, all Washers must adhere to a strict **pet-free and smoke-free policy** within their laundry area and on any equipment used for Services. This is non-negotiable to protect users with allergies and ensure a high standard of cleanliness.
- **Stain Removal & Ironing**: If you offer stain removal, you must possess the necessary expertise and products to attempt stain removal responsibly, understanding that not all stains can be removed. If offering ironing, you must have the appropriate equipment and skill to iron garments professionally without causing damage.

---

## 4. Timeliness & Reliability

- **On-Time Handovers**: Users and Washers are expected to be punctual for scheduled drop-off and pick-up times. Consistent lateness can negatively impact your ratings and may lead to account review.
- **Communication of Delays**: If you anticipate a delay, communicate promptly with the other party via the in-app chat.
- **Washer Availability**: Washers should only accept bookings they are genuinely able to fulfil within the agreed timeframe. Consistent last-minute cancellations, particularly within the 12-hour window, will be penalised as per the Cancellation & Refund Policy.

---

## 5. Handover Procedures & Addresses

- **PIN System Adherence**: Both Users and Washers must diligently follow the PIN system for drop-off and pick-up to ensure a secure chain of custody.
- **Address Privacy**: Users and Washers can choose to meet at pre-determined safe pick-up/drop-off points to avoid disclosing personal addresses. If home pick-up/drop-off is selected, addresses will only be visible to the relevant parties (User and Washer) during the hour before and the hour after the scheduled booking time and its completion. Users and Washers should not attempt to obtain or retain the other party's address outside of this system.

- Issuing a warning.
- Temporary suspension of your account.

Our aim is to maintain a safe, trustworthy, and efficient platform for everyone.
