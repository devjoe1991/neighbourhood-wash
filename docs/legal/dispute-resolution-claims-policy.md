# Dispute Resolution & Claims Policy

Last Updated: 13 July 2025

If a User experiences an issue with a completed service (e.g., damaged or lost items, or concerns about service quality), the following step-by-step process must be followed. This policy is part of our main Terms of Service.

---

## 1. Step 1: Direct Communication (Mandatory First Step)

- **Timeframe**: The User and Washer must first attempt to resolve the issue directly through the platform's in-app chat feature within **48 hours** of the Pick-up PIN being verified and the service marked as complete.
- **Purpose**: This initial step is designed to encourage amicable resolution between the parties whose contract for services is direct. Many issues can be resolved quickly and efficiently at this stage.
- **Documentation**: Users should document the issue with clear photos or videos of any damage or discrepancy, and provide a clear description of the problem.

## 2. Step 2: Escalation to Neighbourhood Wash

- **When to Escalate**: If a satisfactory resolution is not reached through direct communication within the 48-hour timeframe, either the User or the Washer can escalate the dispute to Neighbourhood Wash.
- **How to Escalate**: To escalate, send an email to **team@neighbourhoodwash.com** with the following information:
  - The relevant **Booking ID**.
  - A clear and concise summary of the issue.
  - Evidence collected (e.g., photos, screenshots of chat logs).
  - Details of attempts to resolve the issue directly.

---

## 3. Step 3: Mediation and Evidence Review

- **Our Role**: Upon escalation, Neighbourhood Wash will review the information provided by both parties. We will act as a neutral mediator to help facilitate a fair resolution, but we are **not an arbiter** and have no legal obligation to provide financial compensation.
- **Evidence Required**: We will request all relevant evidence from both parties, which may include:
  - Clear photos or videos of the items before and after the service (if available).
  - Detailed descriptions of the items and the alleged damage/loss.
  - Screenshots of relevant communication via the in-app chat.
  - The timestamped Drop-off and Pick-up PIN verification logs, which serve as key evidence confirming the chain of custody.
  - Any other information pertinent to the dispute.
- **Responsibility for Items**: Users are solely responsible for checking all garments for personal items (e.g., keys, wallets, phones, jewellery) before handing them over to the Washer. Neighbourhood Wash and the Washer are not liable for any damage to a User's personal items, or to the Washer's equipment, caused by items left in clothing.

## 4. Step 4: Compensation and Outcome

- **No Legal Obligation**: As explicitly stated in our Terms of Service, Neighbourhood Wash's role is solely that of a technology platform facilitating bookings. The contract for services is directly between the User and the Washer. Therefore, Neighbourhood Wash has **no legal obligation to provide financial compensation** for damaged or lost items, or for any disputes arising from the provision of Services.
- **Discretionary Platform Credit**: However, at our **sole discretion** and purely as a gesture of goodwill, Neighbourhood Wash may offer platform credit to the User or Washer. Any such offer is not an admission of liability and does not set a precedent for future disputes.
- **Recommendation**: We strongly encourage Users and Washers to maintain open communication and resolve issues amicably. The Platform's dispute resolution process is designed to assist, but it is not an insurer for laundry services.

## 5. Abuse Policy

Any form of physical, verbal, or mental abuse directed towards a User or Washer during the dispute resolution process or at any other time will not be tolerated. Neighbourhood Wash reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate the account of any party engaging in abusive behaviour and, if deemed necessary, will pass relevant details to the appropriate authorities.
