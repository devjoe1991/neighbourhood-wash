## 2. The Role of Neighbourhood Wash

### 2.1. A Booking Platform

Neighbourhood Wash provides a technology platform that connects Users seeking laundry services with local, independent Washers. We act as a booking agency and facilitator only. Our service is the provision of this Platform, not the provision of laundry services themselves.

### 2.2. Independent Contractors

You acknowledge and agree that Washers are independent, self-employed contractors, not employees, agents, or partners of Neighbourhood Wash. The contract for the provision of the actual laundry Services is a direct contract between the User and the Washer. Neighbourhood Wash is not a party to that contract.

### 2.3. Vetting

While we vet prospective Washers, which includes an application review and mandatory ID verification through our partner Stripe, we do not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of the Services they provide. We do not and cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of these checks. You engage with Washers at your own risk.

## 3. User & Washer Registration

### 3.1. Account Creation

To use most features of the Platform, you must register for an account. You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information and to keep this information updated. You may not impersonate any other person or use a name you are not authorised to use.

### 3.2. Washer Onboarding

Prospective Washers must complete a detailed application, pay a one-time, non-refundable Onboarding Fee of **£50**, unless specific promotions are offered which can change this fee at any time. They must successfully complete our vetting process, including identity verification via Stripe Identity. To receive payments, all Washers must create a Stripe Connect Express account and agree to Stripe's terms and conditions.

## 4. The Booking Process

### 4.1. Creating a Booking

A User requests a Booking by selecting the required Services (e.g., wash, dry, iron, stain removal, hypoallergenic wash) and an available time slot. Users may add special instructions (e.g., for allergies, detergent preferences, or specific care). The Platform will then either make the booking available to Washers to accept or automatically assign it to the closest and most available Washer within 24 hours of the requested booking time.

### 4.2. 8:00 PM Booking Restriction

To prevent noise disturbances and anti-social behaviour in residential areas, the Platform strictly prohibits booking time slots that end after 8:00 PM. Users will not be able to select or request such time slots during the booking process.

### 4.3. PIN Verification System

Upon booking confirmation, a unique **Drop-off PIN** is generated. The Washer must enter this PIN into their dashboard to confirm they have received the User's laundry.

Upon service completion, a second unique **Pick-up PIN** is generated. The User provides this Pick-up PIN to the Washer, who must enter it to confirm the service is complete and the items have been returned to the User.

This dual PIN system creates a timestamped, digital chain of custody. Verification of the Pick-up PIN serves as the User's confirmation that the Service is complete and the items have been returned to their satisfaction. This action triggers the final payment capture.

### 4.4. User Agreement at Booking

By confirming a Booking, you, the User, explicitly agree and acknowledge:

- That Washers are independent contractors and Neighbourhood Wash is a facilitator.
- You accept the platform's Cancellation & Refund Policy.
- You understand and agree to use the PIN System for handovers.
- You agree to the platform's Limitation of Liability as detailed in these Terms.
- You understand that it is your responsibility to check all garments for personal items (e.g., keys, wallets, phones) before handover. Neighbourhood Wash and the Washer are not liable for any damage to your personal items or the Washer's equipment caused by items left in clothing.

### 4.5. Safe Pick-up and Drop-off Points

Users and Washers have the option to arrange to meet at pre-determined safe pick-up and drop-off points to avoid disclosing personal addresses. If this option is chosen, personal addresses associated with the booking will not be displayed. If direct home pick-up/drop-off is selected, addresses will only be visible to the relevant parties (User and Washer) during the hour before and the hour after the scheduled booking time and its completion.

## 5. Payments, Commissions & Payouts

### 5.1. Payments

Users must provide valid payment card details at the time of booking. All payments are securely processed by our third-party payment provider, **Stripe**. We do not store your full payment card details. Payment for the full booking amount is authorised when the Booking is made and captured upon successful verification of the Pick-up PIN.

### 5.2. Platform Commission

Neighbourhood Wash deducts a **15% service commission** from the total booking price paid by the User. This commission is for the use of the Platform, payment processing, and facilitation services. You acknowledge and agree that this commission rate may change at any time, and we reserve the right to modify it with prior notice.

### 5.3. Washer Earnings & Payouts

The remaining amount of the booking (total price minus the 15% commission) is credited to the Washer's platform wallet. Washers can request a payout of their balance at any time. Each payout transaction is subject to a fixed **£2.50 Payout Fee**. You acknowledge and agree that this payout fee may change at any time, and we reserve the right to modify it with prior notice.

## 6. Community Guidelines & Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Platform lawfully and respectfully. You will not:

- Engage in any activity that is illegal, fraudulent, or harmful.
- Harass, threaten, or abuse other users, whether physically or mentally. Any form of abuse will result in immediate account termination and may lead to details being shared with appropriate authorities.
- Post User Content that is defamatory, obscene, or discriminatory.
- Attempt to circumvent the Platform by arranging bookings or payments outside of it.
- Violate hygiene standards. All laundry must be in a reasonable state of cleanliness (e.g., free from excessive bodily fluids, hazardous materials, or excessive animal hair).
- Discriminate against any User or Washer based on race, gender, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic.
- Require or expect Washers to provide Services that conflict with the **Pet-Free & Smoke-Free Policy** detailed in the Washer Agreement and Community Guidelines, which applies universally to maintain a safe environment for all users, particularly those with allergies.

Violation of these guidelines may result in account suspension or termination.

## 7. Cancellation & Refund Policy

Our Cancellation & Refund Policy is a part of these Terms. Please review it for detailed information on cancellation timeframes and refund eligibility for both Users and Washers.

---

## 8. Dispute Resolution & Claims

Our Dispute Resolution & Claims Policy is a part of these Terms. In the event of an issue, such as lost or damaged items, you must first attempt to resolve it directly with the other party. If a resolution cannot be reached, you may escalate it to us. We may act as a neutral mediator, but we are not an arbiter and have no obligation to provide compensation.

---

## 9. Liability

### 9.1. Our Liability is Limited

To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to our role as a technology platform. Because the contract for Services is between the User and the Washer, we are not liable for any direct or indirect damages, including but not limited to, damage to clothing, lost items, missed deadlines, personal injury arising from the Services, or damage to a Washer's equipment caused by items left in User's garments.

### 9.2. No Liability for User Interactions

We are not responsible for the conduct of any User or Washer, either online or offline. You use the Platform and the Services at your own risk.

### 9.3. Financial Liability Cap

Should we be found liable for any reason, our liability to you will not exceed the total amount of commission we have received from your bookings in the preceding six (6) months.

### 9.4. Washer Insurance

We do not provide any form of insurance to Washers. Washers are solely responsible for obtaining their own public liability and any other relevant business insurance to cover their activities. We strongly recommend they do so.

## 10. Intellectual Property

All content and technology on the Platform, including the code, design, logos, and text, are the exclusive property of Neighbourhood Wash Technologies Ltd. You may not copy, reproduce, or create derivative works from our content without our express written permission. By posting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute that content on our Platform.

## 11. Termination

You can terminate your account at any time by contacting us. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Platform at our discretion, without notice, if you violate these Terms or for any other reason we deem appropriate to protect the integrity and safety of the Platform and its users.

## 12. General

### 12.1. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

### 12.2. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes, and your continued use of the Platform after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the new Terms.

### 12.3. Severability

If any part of these Terms is deemed unlawful or unenforceable, that part will be severed, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
