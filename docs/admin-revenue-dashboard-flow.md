    SUM(booking_total) as gross_revenue,
    SUM(platform_fee) as commission_earned,

```sql
SELECT 
    p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as washer_name,
    COUNT(e.id) as bookings_completed,

    AVG(e.booking_total) as avg_booking_value
FROM earnings e
JOIN profiles p ON e.washer_id = p.id
WHERE e.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY e.washer_id, washer_name
ORDER BY commission_generated DESC
LIMIT 10;

### Revenue Growth Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) as month,
    SUM(platform_fee) as monthly_commission,
    LAG(SUM(platform_fee)) OVER (ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at)) as prev_month,
    ROUND(
        ((SUM(platform_fee) - LAG(SUM(platform_fee)) OVER (ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at))) 
        / LAG(SUM(platform_fee)) OVER (ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at))) * 100, 2
    ) as growth_percentage
FROM earnings
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC;
