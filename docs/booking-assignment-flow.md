# 🚀 **Neighbourhood Wash - Intelligent Booking Assignment System**

## 📋 **Overview**

The Neighbourhood Wash platform implements a sophisticated, multi-tiered booking assignment system designed to optimize washer-customer matching while maintaining industry-leading security standards and user experience.

## 🔄 **Complete Booking Flow Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Booking Creation**

_User initiates service request_

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B(User Creates Booking);
    B --> C{Booking Saved with Status: 'pending_washer_assignment'};
    C --> D{Washer Available?};
    D -- Yes --> E[Assign Washer];
    D -- No --> F[Hold in Pool];
    F --> G((Auto-Assign Cron Job));
    G --> E;
    E --> H(Notify User & Washer);
    H --> I[End];
```

## Workflow Explanation

1.  **User Creates Booking:** A customer initiates and pays for a laundry booking.
2.  **Booking Saved:** Upon successful payment, a new record is created in the `bookings` table with a status of `pending_washer_assignment`.
3.  **Washer Availability Check:** The system immediately checks for available washers who can service the booking's location and requirements.
4.  **Manual Acceptance Pool:** The booking is available in the "Available Bookings" pool for any verified washer to accept manually. This gives proactive washers a chance to claim jobs first.
5.  **Auto-Assignment Cron Job:** If a booking remains unassigned for a set period (e.g., 10 minutes), a scheduled Supabase Edge Function (`auto-assign-bookings`) runs.
6.  **Assign Washer:** The cron job's algorithm selects the most suitable washer based on location, availability, and other metrics, and assigns them the booking. The booking status is updated to `washer_assigned`.
7.  **Notifications:** Both the user and the assigned washer receive notifications about the confirmed booking details.
8.  **End:** The assignment process is complete.

## Key Components

-   **`createBooking` Server Action:** Creates the initial booking record.
-   **`AvailableBookingsClient` Component:** Displays unassigned bookings to washers.
-   **`acceptBooking` Server Action:** Allows washers to manually accept a booking.
-   **`auto-assign-bookings` Edge Function:** The cron job that automatically assigns bookings.
-   **`booking_statuses` Table:** Manages the different states a booking can be in.
-   **Notifications System:** (To be implemented) For alerting users and washers.

### **Phase 2: Washer Discovery & Selection**

_Intelligent matching begins_

```mermaid
graph TD
    F[Available Bookings Display] --> G[Washers Browse Local Jobs]
    G --> H{Washer Accepts?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Instant Assignment]
    H -->|No| J[Remains Available]
    I --> K[Status: 'washer_assigned']
    K --> L[User Receives 24h Notice]
    J --> M[Continue Available Pool]
```

**Privacy Protection System:**

- 📍 **Location**: Postcode beginning only (e.g., "SW1A...")
- 👤 **Identity**: First name + last initial (e.g., "Joe C.")
- 📅 **Timing**: Full collection date/time
- 💰 **Value**: Total booking value
- 📝 **Services**: Service type and quantity

**Acceptance Flow:**

- Race condition protection (first-come-first-served)
- Instant status updates
- Real-time availability management

---

### **Phase 3: Auto-Assignment Fallback**

_24-hour intelligent assignment_

```mermaid
graph TD
    N[24 Hours Elapsed] --> O[Auto-Assignment Triggered]
    O --> P[Fetch All Available Washers]
    P --> Q[Intelligent Scoring Algorithm]
    Q --> R[Assign Best Match]
    R --> S[Status: 'washer_assigned']
    S --> T[Notifications Sent]
```

**Intelligent Scoring Algorithm:**

1. **Location Proximity** (100 points max)
   - Same postcode area: 100 points
   - Same postcode district: 50 points
2. **Service Area Coverage** (20 points max)
   - Larger service radius = higher score
3. **Experience Factor** (10 points max)
   - Longer tenure = slight preference
4. **Availability Schedule** (20 points max)
   - Configured schedule = bonus points

**Security Measures:**

- Multiple assignment prevention
- Database-level constraints
- Atomic operations
- Race condition handling

### **Phase 4: Active Communication**

_Real-time coordination_

```mermaid
graph TD
    U[Washer Assigned] --> V[Chat System Activated]
    V --> W[Real-time Messaging]
    W --> X[Coordination & Updates]
    X --> Y[Service Progression]
```

**Chat Features:**

- Real-time messaging via Supabase Realtime
- Auto-scrolling interface
- Profile-based avatars
- Message timestamps
- Mobile-responsive design
- Character limits for quality control

---

### **Phase 5: Service Execution**

_Secure handover process_

```mermaid
graph TD
    Z[Service Begins] --> AA[PIN Verification System]
    AA --> BB[Drop-off PIN: 4-digit unique]
    BB --> CC[Collection PIN: 4-digit unique]
    CC --> DD[Status: 'in_progress']
    DD --> EE[Service Completion]
    EE --> FF[Status: 'completed']
    FF --> GG[Payment Release]
```
